# Mega Hack Translation Project

This project aims to provide accurate translations for Mega Hack in languages other than British English. The first translations will be available in Mega Hack v8.1.0, which is in active development.

## Contributing

To contribute to existing languages, please edit the existing language's JSON and create a pull request with your changes.

To contribute a new language, you will need to copy the [base.json](/langs/base.json) and rename it such that the filename is in the format "aa-AA.json" where:
- "aa" is the two-letter language code defined in [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes)
- "AA" is the two-letter regional code defined in [ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes)

Regional dialects of languages are allowed too, such as en-US alongside en-GB.

## Translation

Please remember that proper nouns, such as "Mega Hack" and "Geometry Dash", should not be translated.

Translations should not always be literal and instead should match common terms used by the community already. For example, do not translate "wave" if "wave" is the commonly spoken term in your language.

Any tags ending in `/PRE` or `/SUF` are prefixes or suffixes to input boxes respectively.

Tags ending in `/TIP` are tooltips for UI elements.

Please do NOT change any of the tags, they are used to identify the translations.
